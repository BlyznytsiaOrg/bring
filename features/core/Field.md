# Field Injection in Bring

Field injection in Bring involves directly injecting dependencies into class fields using annotations.

### Example:


```
@Component
public class MyClass {
    @Autowired
    private MyDependency dependency;

    // Other class methods...
}

```

### In this example:


- MyClass declares a field dependency annotated with @Autowired.
- Bring identifies this annotated field as the injection point and directly injects the MyDependency instance into the field.

Field injection allows for a concise way of declaring dependencies directly within the class. However, it's important to note that field injection might lead to reduced testability and increased coupling between classes.

Considerations for Field Injection:

- Readability and Clarity: Field injection can make dependencies less visible within the class, potentially affecting code readability.
- Testability: It might be challenging to mock or substitute dependencies during testing when using field injection.
- Coupling: Directly injecting dependencies into fields can increase the coupling between classes, potentially making the code harder to maintain or refactor.

If you're interested in exploring examples of field injection in Bring, you can refer to the test case BringFieldInjectionTest.
This tests case typically demonstrates how Bring instantiates classes and injects dependencies through field.
